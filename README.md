## Description
Application of different Machine Learning algorithms, including Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Decision Trees and Neural Networks and a comparison of theese algorithms. The purpose of the project is to find a binary solution for real-life data - Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis dataset. 
Machine Learning algorithms are taught to identify, whether an entry will have apendicitis or not based on his characteristics.
